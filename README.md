This repository showcases my coding projects in Java.

Chess Game: 
    I created a fully functional chess game in Java, built entirely from scratch. 
    Players input moves via a command line, and the pieces move accordingly on a fully developed GUI.
    I coded each piece’s movement rules and interactions, ensuring the game runs smoothly and accurately. 
    This project showcases my ability to integrate backend logic with user interface design, all while 
    managing complex game mechanics.

Sorting Program:
    I developed a sorting program that tracks and compares the performance of several algorithms, 
    including Merge Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, and Quick Sort. The program evaluates 
    each algorithm by measuring the execution time, number of comparisons, and swaps for 
    different datasets. This project demonstrates my ability to analyze algorithm efficiency, 
    apply data structures knowledge, and understand the trade-offs in computational performance—
    fundamental skills for computer science studies.
