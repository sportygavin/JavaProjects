Java Projects Showcase

This repository contains a collection of my Java coding projects, including a Chess Game and a Sorting Program. Each project demonstrates core programming concepts, algorithms, and my ability to integrate backend logic with graphical user interface (GUI) design. Below are descriptions and setup instructions for each project.
Projects Overview


1. Chess Game
A fully functional chess game built from scratch in Java. Players can input moves via a command line, and piece movements are reflected on a GUI. The game is coded to adhere strictly to chess rules, with each pieceâ€™s movement logic carefully implemented.

    Features:
- Graphical User Interface (GUI) for piece movements
- Command-line interaction for player moves
- Comprehensive handling of piece movement rules and game mechanics

2. Sorting Program
A Java program that compares the performance of multiple sorting algorithms, including Merge Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, and Quick Sort. The program measures the execution time, number of comparisons, and swaps for each algorithm across different datasets, providing a clear understanding of algorithm efficiency.

   Features:
- Performance tracking for multiple sorting algorithms
- Execution time, comparisons, and swap count analysis
- Useful for studying computational efficiency and trade-offs

Getting Started

Prerequisites

To run these Java projects, ensure you have the following installed:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) (version 8 or higher)
- IntelliJ IDEA (or any Java-compatible IDE)
- Git for cloning the repository

Setup Instructions
- Clone the Repository Open your terminal and run the following command:
    bash
- Copy code
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/java-projects-showcase.git
- Replace your-username with your GitHub username.
    Open the Project in IntelliJ IDEA
- Launch IntelliJ IDEA.
    Go to File > Open and select the folder where you cloned the repository.
    When prompted, select Open as Project.
- Configure Project SDK
    In IntelliJ, go to File > Project Structure and make sure the Project SDK is set to the correct JDK version.
    If necessary, add the JDK by selecting Add JDK and navigating to the location of your Java installation.
- Run the Project
    In the Project pane, navigate to the main class for each project (e.g., Main in the chess-game or sorting-program directory).
    Right-click on the main class file and select Run 'Main' to start the program.

Usage Instructions

Chess Game

- Start the game by running the main class in the chess-game directory.
- Follow the on-screen command-line prompts to input moves.
- The GUI will display the chess board, updating pieces as moves are made.


Sorting Program
- Run the main sorting class in the sorting-program directory.
- The program will prompt you to select an algorithm and dataset size.
- Upon execution, it will display the performance metrics (time, comparisons, and swaps) for the selected sorting algorithm.
